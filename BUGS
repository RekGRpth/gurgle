Lots :-(

Unary minus operator and parsing is broken, eg. "5-1" will fail, add spaces
to workaround, eg. "5 - 1". Also use "0 - 1" for a negative literal number.

Order of banner macros in definition file must match order of declared sort
fields for correct behaviour.

Cannot use a "roll .. through" construct
within a conditional construct when the colon suffix form is used.

A field reference immediately after a ? will be mis-interpreted and will
cause and, to workaround simply put in a separator. For example,
"1=1?%FLD1:;" will break, either "1=2?\%FLD1:;" or "1=2? %FLD1:;" would
be okay though.
