GURGLE - GNU REPORT GENERATOR LANGUAGE
======================================

The GURGLE program reads record and field information from a dBase3+ file,
delimited ascii text file or from an SQL query to a RDBMS and produces a
report listing. Although the program was originally designed to produce
TeX/LaTeX formatted output, plain ascii text, troff, PostScript, HTML,
XML, shell scripts or any other kind of ascii based output format can be
produced just as easily.

The program is ideal for generating large bodies of text where small
parts of that text are substituted with information from a database. So
its great for generating mainly static web pages which have small amounts
of dynamic content.

The formatting process of is controlled by a definition file which holds
the report, page, and record layouts, what fields to display, and where.
Other useful functions supported in the definition file include sorting,
filtering, and data manipulation of records in the databases.

Below is a summary of the main features of GURGLE.

  *   Support ASCII delimited text and dBase3+ databases
  *   Supports GNUSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and CA-Ingres databases
  *   Multiple input databases or queries
  *   Sorting of database records
  *   Automatic banner placement at the start of each sorted group
  *   Filters using regular expressions or user defined functions
  *   Five main text bodies - header, footer, record, 1st page, and Nth page
  *   User defined macros and text bodies
  *   User defined functions on field contents, including conditionals
  *   User configurable input parsing patterns (default is like awk)
  *   Include files
  *   Environment variables
  *   System variables
  *   Multiple file output
  *   General purpose processing language
  *   Optional GUILE support

DOWNLOAD
--------

The program can be downloaded by going to:

  http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/timc/gurgle/

The URL for the current release is:

  http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/timc/gurgle/gurgle-1.61.tar.gz

Alternatively goto the GNU home page at:

  http://directory.fsf.org/project/gurgle

UNPACK
------

To unpack do:

  tar xvzf gurgle-1.61.tar.gz
  cd gurgle-1.61

If your tar command does not have compression support do:

  gunzip -c gurgle-1.61.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  cd gurgle-1.61

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The program can be built with no RDBMS support or it can be built to
include support for one (and only one) RDBMS. It can also be built with
support for GUILE. See one of the specific installation sections below.

DEFAULT INSTALLATION
--------------------

To compile, build and install the default version of GURGLE which has
support for delimited text files and dBase3+ (.dbf) files but no support
for a RDBMS do the following:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

If you want support for a RDBMS or you want support for GUILE see the
specific installation sections below.

GNUSQL RDBMS INSTALLATION
-------------------------

To compile, build and install a version of GURGLE which also has support
for the GNUSQL RDBMS do the following:

  ./configure --enable-gnusql
  make
  make install

The "gsqlc" program (part of the GNUSQL distribution) will be required to
pre-process the driver source and must be in your path.

POSTGRESQL RDBMS INSTALLATION
-----------------------------

To compile, build and install a version of GURGLE which also has support
for the PostgreSQL RDBMS do the following:

  ./configure --enable-postgres
  make
  make install

MYSQL RDBMS INSTALLATION
------------------------

To compile, build and install a version of GURGLE which also has support
for the MySQL RDBMS do the following:

  ./configure --enable-mysql
  make
  make install

You may need to do the following before the ./configure so that the MySQL
libraries are correctly found and used during compilation:

  export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib/mysql

INGRES RDBMS INSTALLATION
-------------------------

To compile, build and install a version of GURGLE which also has support
for the CA-Ingres RDBMS do the following:

  ./configure --enable-ingres
  make
  make install

You may need to set the II_SYSTEM environment variable as appropriate to
your local installation of CA-Ingres before the build so that the
<EM>esqlc</EM> program (part of the CA-Ingres distribution) and libraries
can be found.

GUILE INSTALLATION
------------------

To compile, build and install a version of GURGLE which also has support
for embedded GUILE equate processing do the following:

  ./configure --enable-guile
  make
  make install

The "--enable-guile" option can also be used in combination with any one
of the specific RDBMS installations above.

OTHER CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------------

Other standard configuration options are supported, to set a non-default
installation path for example. See the INSTALL file for details on these.

You may want to prefix the final program name based on the RDBMS name it
has been built with, so for MySQL for example:

  ./configure --enable-mysql --program-prefix=my

would install the program as "mygurgle".
